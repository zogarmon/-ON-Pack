§6My sons... they're dead, aren't they?

§4We don't know that, Sire. The messenger only said they were attacked.

§6No, they're dead. I know it.

§4My job right now is to get you to safety.

...

§6I know this place... the prison?

§4Yes, your Majesty. Beneath the Legion compound. We're headed for a secret passage known only to the Blades. No one can follow us through here.

§6You... I've seen you... let me see your face... you are the one from my dreams... then the stars were right, and this is the day. Gods give me strength.

§fWhat's going on?

§6Assassins attacked my sons, and I'm next. My Blades are leading me out of the city along a secret escape route. By chance, the entrance to that escape route leads through your cell.

§fWhy am I in jail?

§6Perhaps the Gods have placed you here so that we may meet. As for what you have done... it does not matter. That is not what you will be remembered for.

§fWho are you?

§6I am your emperor, Uriel Septim. By the grace of the Gods, I serve Tamriel as her ruler. You are a citizen of Tamriel, and you, too, shall serve her in your own way.

§fWhat should I do?

§6You will find your own path. Take care... there will be blood and death before the end.

§fI go my own way.

§6So do we all. But what path can be avoided whose end is fixed by the almighty Gods?

...

§cAre you all right, Sire? We're clear for now.

§6Captain Renault?

§cShe's dead. I'm sorry, Sire, but we have to keep moving.

§6Here you must find your own path. But we will cross paths before the end, I am sure of it.

...

§cI think that was all of them. Let me take a look around.

§6Have you seen the prisoner?

§cDo you think PLAYERNAME followed us? How could they?

§6I know they did.

§9Your Majesty, we need to keep moving.

§6Not yet. Let me rest a moment longer.

...

§9Dammit, it's that prisoner again! Kill them, they might be working with the assassins.

§6No. PLAYERNAME is not one of them. PLAYERNAME can help us. PLAYERNAME must help us.

§9As you wish, sire.

§6Come closer. I'd prefer not to have to shout.

§6I need your help. Please come with us.

§6Don't be afraid. My guardians will not harm you.

§6They cannot understand why I trust you. They've not seen what I've seen. How can I explain. Listen. You know the Nine? How they guide our fates with an invisible hand?

§fThe Nine guide and protect us.

§6I've served the Nine all my days, and I chart my course by the cycles of the heavens. The skies are marked with numberless sparks, each a fire, and every one a sign. I know these stars well, and I wonder... which sign marked your birth?

...

§6The signs I read show the end of my path. My death, a necessary end, will come when it will come.

§fWhat about me?

§6Your stars are not mine.

§fCan you see my fate?

§6My dreams grant me no opinions of success. Their compass ventures not beyond the doors of death. But in your face, I behold the sun's companion. The dawn of Akatosh's bright glory may banish the coming darkness. With such hope, and with the promise of your aid, my heart must be satisfied.

§fAren't you afraid to die?

§6No trophies of my triumphs precede me. But I have lived well, and my ghost shall rest easy. Men are but flesh and blood. They know their doom, but not the hour. In this I am blessed to see the hour of my death... to face my apportioned fate, then fall.

§fWhere are we going?

§6I go to my grave. A tongue shriller than all the music calls me. You shall follow me yet for a while, then we must part.

...

§6My guards are strong and true, but even the might of the Blades cannot stand against the Power that rises to destroy us. The Prince of Destruction awakes, born anew in blood and fire. These cutthroats are but his mortal pawns.

§6Take my Amulet. Give it to Jauffre. I have a secret son, and Jauffre alone knows where to find him.

§6Find the last of my blood, and close shut the marble jaws of Oblivion.

§fWhat Amulet?

§6The Amulet of Kings. It is the Empire's sacred emblem of rulership. It must pass to the last of the Dragon's Blood. Keep it safe from the pawns of the Destroyer.

§fSo, this is it?

§6For me, it ends here. You are our only hope to stem the blood tide. Give me your hand.

§fWith all my heart... farewell...

§6Stand true, my friend. May your heart be your guide and the gods grant you strength.

§fI won't forget you...

§6Remember me, and remember my words. This burden is now yours alone. You hold our future in your hands. PLAYERNAME.
